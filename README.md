Need to develop software - Car rental information system. The system stores information about the make and model of the car, the state registration number, the cost of renting a car per day, and also the maximum allowable distance that can be driven after renting a car. After implementing the basic version of the information system, the salon owners wanted to add the ability to add discounts (for example, on holidays or weekends). When granting a discount, the cost of renting a car decreases, and the maximum allowable distance increases, by values ​​determined by the terms of the promotion. Over time, the cabin owners also wanted to add the ability to take into account the contact information (last name, first name, series and passport number) of clients of the salon when renting a car. Think over the optimal application architecture taking into account possible changes in customer requirements and implement the information system described above.
